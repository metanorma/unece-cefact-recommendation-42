It also specifically includes a measurement of the time and cost of the complete range of procedures as one of the main outputs of the analysis. This combination makes it suitable as the basis/core of a trade facilitation monitoring and improvement system.</p>
<p id="_b3daff68-d888-419a-a165-3aa741c39099">The Business Process Analysis Plus (BPA+) approach is built upon the BPA concept and supplemented by other methods such as Time-Cost-Distance (TCD), Corridor Performance Measurement and Monitoring (CPMM) and Time Release Studies (TRS).</p>

<p id="_20fbdedd-6463-4ee4-b40b-dc642135e848">TCD/CPMM and TRS, which focus on a subset of procedures covered by BPA (See the Figure above) and provide alternative data collection methods, could be used to verify and supplement the data and outputs from the standard BPA. BPA data is typically based on interviews with key informants, which are verified through stakeholder consultation(s), while TCD/CPMM is often based on the accumulation of quantitative information provided by drivers moving a single shipment along a selected route. TRS is based on data collection forms filled by Customs officers, customs brokers or electronic time stamps (when available) for a sample of shipments/customs declarations.</p>
<p id="_04ee155e-dc9f-4a44-9918-1c3e4a724883">Another difference between BPA and the other two methods (TRS and TCD/CPMM) is that BPA not only provides indicators, but also provides a ‘standard’ way of analyzing indicators, trade procedures, identifying bottlenecks and diagnosing trade barriers—while the other two methods mainly provide indicators.</p>
